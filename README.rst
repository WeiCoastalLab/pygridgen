------------

C Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following dependencies are all available via conda-forge for Linux and Mac OS:

* `nn feedstock`_
* `csa feedstock`_
* `gridgen feedstock`_
* `gridutils feedstock`_

.. _nn feedstock: https://github.com/conda-forge/nn-feedstock
.. _csa feedstock: https://github.com/conda-forge/csa-feedstock
.. _gridgen feedstock: https://github.com/conda-forge/gridgen-feedstock

Python
~~~~~~

Provided that all of the shared C libraries are installed, the remaining python depedencies are the following:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* pyproj (only if working with geographic coordinates)

Testing
~~~~~~~

Tests are written using the `pytest` package.
From the source tree, run them simply with by invoking ``pytest`` in a terminal.
If you're editing the source code, it helps to have `pytest-pep8` installed to check code style.

Alternatively, from the source tree you can run ``python check_pygridgen.py --strict`` to run the units tests, style checker, and doctests.

Documentation
